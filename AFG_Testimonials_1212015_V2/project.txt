Private Wealth Advisory Practice State: California  PlanSource Relationship 38 plans in 2014 162 cumulative plans  I just wanted to take a moment to express how pleased I have been with working with both Rashmi and Vishal over this last year... Rashmi has been very prompt at coordinating and following up throughout the PlanSource process - she is a great facilitator. Vishal has been instrumental at producing consistently accurate results across a myriad of different cases and client scenarios. His attention to detail and knowledge of the NaviPlan software has given me the highest confidence in the final product and I cannot imagine how I could ever have worked these plans myself or through any other financial planning service. I believe the process is very streamlined and easy to use. My only suggestion would be to make calendaring each step a virtual process too - e.g. be able to log into a site and block out time - I understand that this might create some rough patches, so it is not a must - only a wish-list item. - by Ryan Lee, Associate Financial Advisor with the practice of George Papadoyannis ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Teranishi","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Teranishi","title":"Steve Teranishi CFPÂ® Financial Advisor Ameriprise Platinum Financial ServicesÂ® Practice State: California  PlanSource Relationship 72 plans in 2014 144 cumulative plans 27 cumulative SPS received  Thank you for your help with the various financial plan deliverables.

The turn around time on work he does is lightening fast. This reduces my stress because I don't have to wonder whether he will get his stuff to me in time. His data entry is accurate. Part of the result of this is that the amount of time me and my staff have to spend on planning has been dramatically reduced. He takes great notes and never has to ask a question twice. He makes note of all my idiosyncratic preferences. His assumptions he includes in the written plan reduce the questions my clients have and the amount of time I have to spend looking up what assumption was used. His availability is great...until 3pm west coast time and he never is too busy to talk to me or respond to an email. I would happily recommend PlanSource to my peers.

He also seems to appreciate any constructive feedback I might have. For the most part, we are at a point where I need only review the plan with a few changes before delivery.

I wanted to increase my number of plans without having to spend the time and money hiring a new staff person.  Also, since I do not have the office space necessary to accommodate another person.  Using PlanSource was a great solution.  Once I scan the data over to them, they input the data properly so I do not have to worry about the output being inaccurate.  Since, this is all they do I view them as the experts.  After I receive the completed plan and review it.  If I see a recommendation I want to add I can quickly add it.  Another benefit I see is the peace of mind in knowing my plans meet compliance expectations and standards. By making PlanSource a part of my team, I feel I have an unlimited amount of capacity for increasing my plan count.  Whenever I meet with a prospect or an existing client, I do not have to worry about having enough staff available.  As a business owner it is no secret the quickest way to get to the next bonus level is to increase your plan count.  Last year I was able to increase my plan count and receive a bonus, thanks to PlanSource.

In this short amount of time, he has helped to streamline our planning process, deliver plans in a timely matter, and provide clients with comprehensive, fact supported advice. Nitin helps our office stay on track. Nitin always responds to emails in a very timely fashion and regularly calls to remind us of upcoming due dates. Nitin analyzes client data with accuracy and precision. He recently asked a question about a line item on a new planning clientâs paystub. The question prompted us to contact the client and the client to then ask his employer for more information. The simple fact finding question ultimately resulted in helping the client receive $3,500 of dividend checks that had been mailed to the wrong address for the past three years.

Any edits that I request are completed promptly. I have been impressed with the PlanSource teamâs professionalism as well as their very knowledgeable approach to planning. PlanSource is a very flexible group that cheerfully accommodates my officeâs approach to planning with regular telephone conferences in addition to e-mail correspondence. Although we try to avoid ârush jobs,â on those occasions when we are very close to a deadline, PlanSource is always sensitive to our need to complete a plan by its due date and they work very hard to ensure that no plan is ever late.  Every member of the PlanSource team that has interacted with my office has been consistently courteous, professional, and gracious. I recommend them highly.

I wanted to make a point of telling you how much I appreciate you and your help. I also thought you would enjoy knowing that my plan count is up over 25% from last year.

Mohit is always flexible with regards to scheduling time to call and follows up quickly on plans to meet my deadlines. The plans I receive from Mo look professional and are very accurate. He has a good understanding of financial planning and pays attention to detail; being able to easily decipher data that I give him in the form of paystubs or other statements.  He is open to feedback on how I like the plans formatted or changes I need. He asks about other options to add value such as insurance proposals, investment cut sheets, Morningstar reports.  When I receive data from the client I have my staff assemble it into a file folder in the clientâs online file. I review the data, perhaps add a note to Mo, and email it. It is a great time saver. He sends me a draft of the plan â we review by phone or I just send him an email note. He is very professional in every way. His written and spoken English is excellent.  I would recommend him to other advisors for financial planning support.

He is always punctual, professional, and personable. The quality of the financial plans he puts out are well worth what I pay to PlanSource. We have worked well together and he is patient with me when he teaches me the intricacies of NaviPlan. Whether he is running an insurance proposal for me or revising a draft for the 2nd or 3rd time to get it just right, he is always open to feedback. I would recommend Vishal to any advisor who wants to free up significant amounts of time by outsourcing the preparation of their deliverables.
